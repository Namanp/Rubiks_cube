# Rubiks_cube
The application is largely unfinished but it has a working login and registration with authetication. Once you npm start the application, you can run the server.js to start the application on localhost:3000. There you can make an account through registration and then login with that information. Once you are logged in and you switch tabs in the app, a rubik's cube appears but it is rather buggy. The 3D animation was taken from an online resource and I was unable to fully understand its workings, thus the application does not have the capability to save your moves or track time.
